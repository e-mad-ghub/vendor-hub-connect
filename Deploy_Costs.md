Backend hosting (Node API): $5–$15 (Render/Fly/Railway “starter” or small VPS) for 24/7 uptime + HTTPS.
Postgres (managed): $5–$15 for a small instance with persistence/backups (Render/Railway/Neon/RDS).
Object storage/CDN for product images: S3/Spaces/B2 or similar: <$5 at low usage (pennies per GB + requests); budget $5.
Frontend hosting: free tier likely sufficient (Lovable/Vercel/Netlify) → $0 unless higher limits needed.
Domain: ~$10–$15/year (≈$1/month); TLS via Let’s Encrypt is free.
Optional email/SMS notifications: pay per send; can defer.
Optional monitoring/logging (Sentry/logtail/etc.): free tier at low volume; paid if higher volume.
Approximate total for a minimal reliable setup: ~$15–$40/month depending on provider and usage.
